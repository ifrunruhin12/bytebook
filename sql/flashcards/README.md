# 🧠 Flashcards

This folder contains markdown-based flashcards in a CLI-inspired format for rapid review and memory retention.

## 📁 Structure
- `flashcards.md`: Contains all current Q&A entries for what I've learned so far.
- I can later break them into smaller files by topic if needed (e.g., `constraints.md`, `joins.md`).

⚡ Use these for spaced repetition or Anki import.
