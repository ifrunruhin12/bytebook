# 📜 Cheatsheet

This folder contains concise, copy-paste-ready SQL syntax and summaries of core concepts.
Designed as a quick reference while I'm working or revising.

## 📁 Structure
- `00-sql-cheatsheet.md`: A living document of all SQL knowledge learned so far.
- Additional cheat files may be added by topic (e.g., `joins.md`, `subqueries.md`, `ddl-vs-dml.md`)

✅ Will Update regularly as I learn more.
