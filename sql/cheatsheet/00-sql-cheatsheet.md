# 🧠 SQL Cheatsheet (In Progress...)

### 📌 What is a Database?
- A **database** is a collection of related information or data that can be stored, managed, and retrieved.

### 📌 SQL vs NoSQL
- **SQL**: Structured Query Language used to manage **Relational** Databases (RDBMS).
- **NoSQL**: Used for **Non-Relational** Databases (NRDBMS) like MongoDB, Redis, etc.

### 📌 Arch Linux Tip
- In Arch, **MariaDB** is a drop-in replacement for MySQL.

## 🏗 Table Creation & Management

### ✅ CREATE TABLE
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
```

### ✅ DESCRIBE
```sql
DESCRIBE users;
```

### ✅ ALTER TABLE

- Add column

```sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD age INT;
```

- Modify column

```sql
ALTER TABLE users MODIFY age DECIMAL(5,2);
```

- Drop column

```sql
ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN age;
```

### ✅ DROP TABLE

```sql
DROP TABLE users;
```

## 🔑 Keys in SQL

### 🔹 Primary Key

A column (or set of columns) that **uniquely identifies each row** in a table.

- Must be unique
- Cannot be NULL

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100)
);
```

### 🔹 Foreign Key

A column that **references the primary key of another table** to establish a relationship between them.

- Maintains **referential integrity**
- Can be NULL (if optional relationship)

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);
```

### 🔹 Surrogate Key

An **artificial key** used as a unique identifier (usually `AUTO_INCREMENT` or `UUID`)

- Has no business meaning
- Used instead of natural keys to avoid complications

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
  product_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100)
);
```

### 🔹 Composite Key

A **primary key made of multiple columns**. Used when a single column can’t uniquely identify a row.

```sql
CREATE TABLE enrollment (
  student_id INT,
  course_id INT,
  PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_id)
);
```

### 🔹 Candidate Key

Any column (or set of columns) that **could be a primary key** (i.e., unique and non-null).

- One becomes the primary key, others are alternate keys.


### Alternate Key

A **candidate key** that was not chosen as the primary key but can still uniquely identify rows.


## 📋 Data Types

| Type        | Description                         |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `INT`       | Integer values                      |
| `DECIMAL`   | Fixed-point decimal (money, etc.)   |
| `VARCHAR`   | Variable-length text                |
| `BLOB`      | Binary large object (images, files) |
| `DATE`      | Stores year-month-day               |
| `TIMESTAMP` | Stores date & time                  |


## 🔍 Querying & Data Insertion

### ✅ SELECT
```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

### ✅ INSERT
```sql
INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('Alice', 'alice@example.com');
```

## 🔒 Constraints

| Constraint       | Use Case                               |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `NOT NULL`       | Prevents null entries in a column      |
| `UNIQUE`         | Ensures unique value in a column       |
| `DEFAULT`        | Sets default value if none is provided |
| `AUTO_INCREMENT` | Automatically increments numeric value |


## 📝 UPDATE & DELETE in SQL (MySQL)

### 🔄 `UPDATE` – Modify Existing Records

```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
```

#### ✅ Example:

```sql
-- Update a student's name where ID is 1
UPDATE students
SET name = 'Tanvir Ahmed'
WHERE id = 1;
```

> ⚠️ Always use `WHERE` with `UPDATE` to avoid updating all rows!

---

### ❌ `DELETE` – Remove Records from a Table

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

#### ✅ Example:

```sql
-- Delete a student where ID is 3
DELETE FROM students
WHERE id = 3;
```

> ⚠️ `DELETE` without a `WHERE` clause removes all rows! Use carefully.

---

### 🧪 Pro Tips

- 🔒 Always `SELECT` the rows first before doing an `UPDATE` or `DELETE`:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM students WHERE id = 1;
  ```
- 🧯 Use transactions if you're unsure:
  ```sql
  START TRANSACTION;
  UPDATE students SET name = 'Test' WHERE id = 1;
  ROLLBACK; -- or COMMIT;
  ```

### 🔍 Basic Queries
- Retrieve all columns: `SELECT * FROM table_name;`
- Retrieve specific columns: `SELECT name, age FROM users;`
- Filtering: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 18;`
- Sorting: `SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY name ASC;`
- Limiting: `SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 5;`

### 🧱 Creating a Simple Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    age INT,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
);
```

### 🧮 Functions & Aggregates
- `COUNT(*)` – total rows
- `AVG(column)` – average
- `SUM(column)` – total sum
- `MAX(column)` / `MIN(column)` – max/min values
- `NOW()` – current datetime
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;
SELECT AVG(age) FROM students;
```

### 🔗 JOINS
- **INNER JOIN**: Only matching rows
```sql
SELECT * FROM orders
INNER JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.id;
```
- **LEFT JOIN**: All from left + matched from right
- **RIGHT JOIN**: All from right + matched from left

### 🥚 Nested Queries
```sql
SELECT name FROM students
WHERE id IN (
    SELECT student_id FROM enrollments WHERE course_id = 1
);
```

### 🧬 UNION
- Combine result sets (must have same number of columns)
```sql
SELECT name FROM teachers
UNION
SELECT name FROM students;
```

### 🌟 Wildcards
- `%` = any number of characters
- `_` = a single character
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE 'A%';
SELECT * FROM products WHERE code LIKE '_23%';
```

### 🔐 ON DELETE SET NULL / CASCADE
```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
    ON DELETE SET NULL
);

-- or
ON DELETE CASCADE
-- deletes all related orders when user is deleted
```
## 📘 Advanced SQL & Database Design Concepts

## 🧩 DELIMITER in SQL

By default, SQL statements end with a semicolon `;`. But when writing complex statements like **stored procedures** or **triggers**, we temporarily change the delimiter to avoid premature termination.

### 🔧 Usage:
```sql
DELIMITER $$

CREATE PROCEDURE example_proc()
BEGIN
    -- Multiple SQL statements
    SELECT "Hello";
    SELECT "World";
END $$

DELIMITER ;
```

> `DELIMITER $$` tells the MySQL interpreter to treat `$$` as the end of the command block instead of `;`. This is useful for functions, procedures, and triggers.

---

## ⚡ Triggers

Triggers are special stored procedures that **automatically run** in response to specific events on a table.

### 🧠 Types of Triggers:
- `BEFORE INSERT`
- `AFTER INSERT`
- `BEFORE UPDATE`
- `AFTER UPDATE`
- `BEFORE DELETE`
- `AFTER DELETE`

### ✅ Syntax:
```sql
DELIMITER $$

CREATE TRIGGER before_insert_user
BEFORE INSERT ON users
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    SET NEW.created_at = NOW();
END $$

DELIMITER ;
```

> `NEW` and `OLD` are special keywords to access values during trigger execution.

## 🧬 ER Diagrams (Entity-Relationship Diagrams)

ER diagrams visually represent how **entities** (tables) relate to one another in a database.

### 🧱 Key Concepts:

#### 🧾 Entities:
- Represent **real-world objects** (e.g., Student, Course).
- Become tables in the database.

#### 🔑 Attributes:
- Properties of an entity (e.g., name, age, ID).
- Types:
  - **Simple Attribute**: Cannot be divided (e.g., age).
  - **Composite Attribute**: Can be divided (e.g., name → first, last).
  - **Derived Attribute**: Computed (e.g., age from DOB).
  - **Multivalued Attribute**: Has multiple values (e.g., phone numbers).

#### 🔗 Relationships:
- Connects two or more entities.
- Cardinality types:
  - One-to-One
  - One-to-Many
  - Many-to-Many

#### 🧩 Keys:
- **Primary Key**: Uniquely identifies a record.
- **Foreign Key**: Creates a link between tables.

#### 🔄 Participation:
- **Total Participation**: Every entity must participate in a relationship.
- **Partial Participation**: Optional participation.

---

## 🔖 Example ER Scenario:

**Entities**: Student, Course, Enrollment  
**Relations**:
- A `Student` can enroll in multiple `Courses`.
- A `Course` can have many `Students`.

This forms a **many-to-many** relationship, usually resolved with an intermediate **Enrollment** table.
