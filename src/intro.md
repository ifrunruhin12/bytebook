# 📖 bytebook

> A living notebook of everything I learn in Golang, Rust, and other languages — slowly being forged into a full-blown mdBook.

---

## 🚀 What's Inside?

Organized by language, concept, and chaos-resistance.

- 🟦 Golang
  - [📁 View Golang Notes and Experiments](golang/intro.md)
  - Basics, idioms, concurrency, and project patterns

- 🦀 Rust
  - Ownership, lifetimes, async, and zero-cost abstractions

- 🐍 Python (mostly for scripting tools & small hacks)

- 🧪 Templates
  - Common code snippets and setup scripts

---

## 🔮 Vision

I’ll keep updating this with bite-sized lessons, code experiments, and deeper dives.  
Eventually, this will become a full **mdBook**, so anyone (including future me) can browse and learn.

---

## 🛠 How To Use

- Clone the repo
- Pick your poison (`golang/`, `rust/`, etc.)
- Read the markdown, run the code, level up.

---

## 📘 Planned Features

- Interactive playground links
- Auto-generated `SUMMARY.md` for mdBook
- E-book/PDF export support

---

## 🤝 Contributions

Right now, it's my personal logbook, but in the future I might open it for collabs!

## ⚡ Built With

- Markdown
- mdBook (WIP)
- Love for clean, powerful code
