# ðŸ“¦ The Slice Capacity Growth Rules in Go

Go does not guarantee a strict rule for how slice capacity grows. But there is a pattern based on the Go runtimeâ€™s memory allocator strategy, which optimizes for speed and memory reuse. Itâ€™s not random, but itâ€™s also not always linear or simple.

## ðŸ”¹ Rule 1: Capacity < 1024 â†’ Double the capacity

If the current capacity is less than 1024:
```go
cap = cap * 2
```
But this doubling can sometimes skip a step if Go's allocator decides to round up to the next power-of-two or memory block size (especially for small allocations).

### Example
```go
s := make([]int, 50) // cap = 50
s = append(s, 1)     // cap becomes 112, not 100
```
Why? Go uses `runtime.growslice` under the hood, which often overallocates to align to size classes used by Go's allocator (which uses `mallocgc` behind the scenes).

So 112 is chosen because it matches the next available block size for reuse. Efficient memory reallocation > predictable growth

## ðŸ”¹ Rule 2: Capacity â‰¥ 1024 â†’ Grow by ~25% chunks

```go
newcap := oldcap + oldcap/4
```

So:
    - [] 1024 â†’ 1024 + 256 = 1280
    - [] But Go bumps it to 1536 because of memory allocator class alignment again (usually to avoid fragmentation and reuse existing allocation buckets)

## ðŸ”¹ Rule 3: Alignment to Size Classes

This is the hidden layer that messes with predictability. Go groups allocations into size classes, and sometimes grows a slice to the next class size even if it exceeds the calculated "double" or "25% increase".
These size classes are part of Go's `runtime/sizeclasses.go`. They are not public API but are roughly:
```bash
16, 32, 48, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, ...
```
Thatâ€™s why:
```go
cap 50 â†’ append â†’ cap becomes 112 (because 112 is next best fit)
```
## ðŸ”Ž So how do you predict it?

### You can approximate it like this:
```go
func growCap(oldCap int) int {
	if oldCap < 1024 {
		return nextSizeClass(oldCap * 2)
	}
	return nextSizeClass(oldCap + oldCap/4)
}

func nextSizeClass(n int) int {
	// These are simplified class sizes, not exact.
	classes := []int{16, 32, 48, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 144, 160, 176, 192,
		208, 224, 240, 256, 320, 384, 448, 512, 576, 640,
		704, 768, 832, 896, 960, 1024, 1152, 1280, 1408,
		1536, 1792, 2048, 2304, 2560, 2816, 3072, 3328,
		3584, 3840, 4096, 4608, 5120, 5632, 6144, 6656,
		7168, 7680, 8192}

	for _, c := range classes {
		if c >= n {
			return c
		}
	}
	return n // fallback if class not found
}
```
That would get you very close to how Go grows slices.

## This can change anytime

The Go team can tweak the growth rules in future versions of Go to improve memory performance. So donâ€™t rely on this behavior in production code for anything criticalâ€”just treat it as an optimization detail.
