# Rust Learning Repository

This is my Rust learning repository - a collection of small projects and experiments to help me get better at Rust programming.

## Why I am learning Rust

Rust is a systems programming language that offers memory safety, concurrency, and performance. I am learning Rust to improve my programming skills, build efficient applications, and explore new paradigms in software development.
And also one of my dream project which Jagoron will be made with Rust. Jagoron is a phonetic engine for Bengali language. And it will be modern day version and a better version all together than avro phonetic engine.

> More will be added soon...
